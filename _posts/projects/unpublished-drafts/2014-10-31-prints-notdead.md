From Medium to the New York Times app, publishing brands are embracing clean
and easy-to-read design. Web designers can optimize the online reading
experience to the point of perfection, but some people will always prefer
paper.

In this experiment, hackathon attendees will build a protocol to automate the
construction of a beautiful, elegantly simple PDFs. Users will be able to
download a PDF of each story for a small price (about $1). We believe there
are people who will pay for an elegantly typeset PDF.

Readers will be allowed to read online and print out the web version of the
story for free. But we have a hunch that the online reading "experience" and
what readers value about it is fundamentally different from the paper reading
experience. This not only allows readers to build their own physical magazines
of our content, but to have the story as an object.
