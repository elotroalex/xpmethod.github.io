The Big Roundtable model its pay-what-you-can after Radiohead's 2007
experimental release of their album "In Rainbows," which the band allowed
people to download for free with the option to pay what they like. We didn't
want to inhibit sharing to online readers who would pay for our stories, nor
did we want to give readers the impression that we were giving away stories
for free.

In the 17 plus months since launching, hundreds of Roundtable readers have
donated thousands of dollars to writers. But our conversion rate (from reader
to payer) is still low, and we're eager to make it easier and more fun for
readers to donate, and to experiment with different forms of payment,
especially cryptocurrency, and models.

Placing a "tip jar" on a story page allows the reader to express appreciation
for the writer's effort. We hope that by enabling readers to pay with
cryptocurrencies like BitCoin we'll embrace the new crypto-economy and that
they in turn will embrace us. Additionally, we will acknowledge by name (or
username) each donor on the story page where they've donated.
