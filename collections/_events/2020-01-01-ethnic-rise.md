The [project](https://ethnicrise.github.io/) was implemented as a rapid response to the denial of tenure of Dr. Lorgia García
Peña in 2019, and consisted of two parts: First, a Roundtable, which now provides resources and
entry points to consider the importance of Ethnic Studies to contemporary thought worldwide.
Second, via the Twitter event, [LorgiaFest](https://twitter.com/hashtag/lorgiafest?lang=en). In
this event, scholars from around the world engaged in a public discussion of Dr. García Peña’s
work in an effort to raise awareness of its key insights and reach wider audiences. The event
proved to be one of the largest Twitter academic book clubs organized on Twitter so far. 

In engaging with Dr. García Peña, the team also recognized and honored all of those Ethnic
Studies scholars who have encountered resistance and retaliation for their timely work, and to
the students who need them and fight daily for epistemological insurrection, academic freedom,
and justice in the US academy.
