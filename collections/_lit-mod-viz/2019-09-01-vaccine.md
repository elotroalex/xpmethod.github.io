Language around vaccine hesitancy reveals the public's distrust in science, medicine, and
government. This distrust stands in the way of effective health policy, crucial in the coming
efforts to vaccinate against the COVID-19 virus. Our project seeks to use state-of-the-art
computational methods (a) to collect a significant database of anti-vaccine rhetoric, found in
online forums, discussion groups, and social media; (b) to analyze vaccine hesitancy as a
cultural, linguistic phenomenon so as to better understand its causes and concerns; and (c) to
propose new ways of presenting vaccines to the public in a way that increases compliance.

## Call for Participation

The [Literary Modeling and Visualization Workshop][1] at Columbia University is accepting
applications from student participants interested in contributing to it's first collaborative
research project, entitled Vaccines in the Medical Imagination, led by Professors [Rishi
Goyal][2] (Director of Medicine Literature and Society Program and Assistant Professor of
Medicine) and [Dennis Yi Tenen][3] (Associate Professor, English and Comparative Literature).

As the United States is under threat of losing its Measles elimination status, this project
combines expertise in the Medical Humanities and Computational Literary Analysis to understand
the cultural roots of vaccine hesitancy. By investigating the literary tropes surrounding
vaccination in popular press and in medicine, we will seek to explore how science and the
perception of science are continually shaped by metaphors, which persist within the medical
imaginary.

No prior experience in the medical humanities or formal literary analysis is required. We will
be meeting weekly to review relevant literature, explore archives, draft, diagram, code, and
eventually co-author. Students will have the chance to deepen their existing research skills,
as well as to expand into adjacent methods and approaches. You must be generally available on
Fridays 1-3pm.

Contact either of the faculty leads if you are interested in participating.
